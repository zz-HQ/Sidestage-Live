	<h3>Account Registration</h3>

	In order to access certain features of the Site, and to book a Service or create a Listing, you must register to create an account (“Sidestage Account”) and become a Member. You may register to join the Services directly via the Site or as described in this section.<br>

	You can also register to join by logging into your account with certain third party social networking sites (“SNS”) (including, but not limited to, Facebook); each such account, a “Third Party Account”, via our Site, as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site and Services, you may link your Sidestage Account with Third Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third Party Account login information to Sidestage through the Site or Services; or (ii) allowing Sidestage to access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login information to Sidestage and/or grant Sidestage access to your Third Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating Sidestage to pay any fees or making Sidestage subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third party service providers. By granting Sidestage access to any Third Party Accounts, you understand that Sidestage will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third Party Account (“SNS Content”) so that it is available on and through the Site and Services via your Sidestage Account and Sidestage Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third Party Accounts will be available on and through your Sidestage Account on the Site and Services. If a Third Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Sidestage’s access to such Third Party Account is terminated by the third party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site and Services. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Sidestage Account and your Third Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the “Settings” section of the Site. YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. Sidestage makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and Sidestage is not responsible for any SNS Content.<br>

	We will create your Sidestage Account and your Sidestage Account profile page for your use of the Site based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Sidestage Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Sidestage reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Sidestage Account and your access to the Site and Services if you create more than one (1) Sidestage Account or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Sidestage Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Sidestage of any unauthorized use of your Sidestage Account.<br>

	<h3>Entertainer Listings</h3>

	As a Member, you may create Listings. To this end, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Services to be listed, including, but not limited to, your location, musician genre, availability of the Services and pricing and related rules and financial terms. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site and Services. Other Members will be able to book your Services via the Site and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Customer requests a booking of your Services, the price for such booking may not be altered, unless the Customer requires of you something more or less than what is represented in your Listing. In this case, you will have the opportunity, via the Site, to make the Customer a new offer, which the Customer can accept or decline. If the Customer accepts your new offer, you may not alter the price of that new offer.<br>

	You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Listings you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or Customer engagement, with Services in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Services included in a Listing you post and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Sidestage assumes no responsibility for a Entertainer’s compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations. Sidestage reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Sidestage, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms, or otherwise harmful to the Site or Services.<br>

	You understand and agree that Sidestage does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for you as a Entertainer. If a Customer requests a booking of your Services and retains your Services, any agreement you enter into with such Customer is between you and the Customer; and Sidestage is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sidestage serves as the limited authorized agent of the Entertainer for the purpose of accepting payments from Customers on behalf of the Entertainer and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Entertainer.<br>

	When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your services, including, but not limited to, requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to book your Services. Any Member wishing to book Services included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. <br>

	You acknowledge and agree that, as a Entertainer, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who retain your Services or are otherwise present at the place of Service at your request or invitation, excluding the Customer (and the individuals the Customer invites to the place of Services, if applicable.)<br>

	Sidestage recommends that Entertainers obtain appropriate insurance for their Services. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Services carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Customers (and the individuals the Customer invites to the Services, if applicable) while providing your Services.<br>

	<h3>No Endorsement</h3>

	Sidestage does not endorse any Members or any Services. In addition, although these Terms require Members to provide accurate information, we do not attempt to confirm, and do not confirm, any Member’s purported identity. You are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others who you contact via the Site and Services. Sidestage is not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.<br>

	By using the Site or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm and you agree not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from Sidestage with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Entertainer against Sidestage regarding the remittance of payments received from a Customer by Sidestage on behalf of a Entertainer, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled “Limitation of Liability”.<br>

	<h2>Bookings & Financial Terms</h2>

	<h3>Bookings and Financial Terms for Entertainers</h3>

	The fees displayed in each booking are comprised of the Services Fees (defined below) and the Credit Card Fee (defined below.) Where applicable, Taxes may be charged in addition to the Services Fees and Customer Fees. The Services Fees, the Customer Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “Total Fees”. The amounts due and payable by a Customer solely relating to a Entertainer’s Services are the “Entertainer’s Fee”. It is the Entertainer and not Sidestage which determines the Entertainer’s Fees. The Services Fee may include a travel or late night fee, at the Entertainer’s discretion.<br>

	Sidestage charges an additional Credit Card Fee to Customers based upon a percentage of applicable Entertainer’s Fees. The Credit Card Fees are added to the Entertainer’s Fees to calculate the Total Fees (which will also include applicable Taxes). Sidestage will collect the Total Fees at the time of booking confirmation and will initiate payment of the Entertainer’s Fees (less Sidestage’s commission (defined below)) to the Entertainer within 24 hours of when the Entertainer provides the Services agreed upon.<br>

	<h3>Appointment Sidestage as Payment Agent </h3>

	Each Entertainer hereby appoints Sidestage as their limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments made by Customers on behalf of the Entertainer. Each Entertainer agrees that payment made by a Customer to Sidestage shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Entertainer and the Entertainer will make the Services available to User in the agreed upon manner as if the Entertainer has received the Entertainer’s fees. <br>

	Each Entertainer agrees that, Sidestage may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Entertainer and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Customer to cancel the booking and (ii) refund to the Customer that portion of the Entertainer’s fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Entertainer, Sidestage assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Entertainer.<br>

	At this time Sidestage does not charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you agree that Sidestage reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings. In the event that Sidestage will start charging a fee for Listings, we will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.<br>


	<h3>Booking and Financial Terms for Customers</h3>

	The Entertainers, not Sidestage, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Services reserved through the Site and Services. If you, as a Customer, choose to enter into a transaction with a Entertainer for the booking of a Service, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Entertainer and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Services imposed by the Entertainer. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Sidestage, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Sidestage is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Sidestage disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Sidestage is not a party to the agreement between you and the Entertainer, Sidestage acts as the Entertainer’s payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Entertainer. Upon your payment of amounts to Sidestage which are due to the Entertainer, your payment obligation to the Entertainer for such amounts is extinguished, and Sidestage is responsible for remitting such amounts, less Sidestage’s Fees, to the Entertainer. In the event that Sidestage does not remit any such amounts to a Entertainer, such Entertainer will have recourse only against Sidestage.<br>

	Bookings for Services will specify the Total Fees. You agree to pay Sidestage for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Sidestage Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Entertainer. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Entertainer’s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that Sidestage, on behalf of the Entertainer, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting ( e.g. one euro or one British pound) to verify your credit card. Once Sidestage receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Entertainer, Sidestage will collect the Total Fees in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Sidestage cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Customer by their bank related to Sidestage’s collection of the Total Fees, and Sidestage disclaims all liability in this regard.<br>

	In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address, and credit card information either to Sidestage or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Sidestage for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Sidestage Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site – e.g. credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Sidestage or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site. You also authorize Sidestage to charge your credit card for Security Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to Sidestage’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.<br>

	<h3>Security Deposits</h3>

	Entertainers may choose to include security deposits in their Listings (“Security Deposits”). Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Services. If a Security Deposit is included in a Service for a confirmed booking, Sidestage will, in its capacity as the payment agent of the Entertainer, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a pre-authorization of the Customer’s credit card in the amount the Entertainer determines for the Security Deposit within a reasonable time prior to the date of service. Sidestage will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Entertainers’ requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Sidestage is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Entertainers related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.<br>

	<h3>Services Fees</h3>

	In consideration for providing the Services, Sidestage collects service fees from Entertainers and Customers (“Service Fees”). Service Fees are made up of two (2) components: (i) Credit Card Fees and (ii) a fee that is charged to the Entertainer based upon a percentage of the amount of the Total Fees (“Entertainer Payment Fees”). Where applicable, Taxes may also be charged in addition to the Credit Card Fees. Entertainer Payment Fees are deducted from the Total Fees before remitting the Entertainer’s Fees to the Entertainer, within 24 hours of the time of service. Credit Card Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.<br>

	Balances will be remitted by Sidestage to Entertainers via check, PayPal, direct deposit or other payment methods described on the Site. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.<br>


	<h2>General Booking & Financial Terms</h2>

	<h3>Cancellations & Refunds</h3>

	If, as a Customer, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site and Services, prior to the date of Services, the cancellation policy of the Entertainer contained in the applicable Booking will apply to such cancellation. Our ability to refund the Service Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site.<br>

	If an Entertainer cancels a confirmed booking made via the Site and Services, (i) Sidestage will refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable Customer within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation and (ii) the Customer will receive an email or other communication from Sidestage containing alternative Listings and other related information. If the Customer requests a booking from one of the alternative Listings and the Entertainer associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Customer’s requested booking, then the Customer agrees to pay Sidestage the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the services in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms. If an Entertainer cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Customer, have not received an email or other communication from Sidestage, please contact Sidestage at support@sidestage.com.<br>

	<h3>Taxes</h3>

	You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your applicable Tax reporting requirements in consultation with your tax advisors. Sidestage cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members of the Site and Services. Additionally, each Entertainer is responsible for determining local indirect Taxes and for including any applicable Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. Where applicable, or based upon request from an Entertainer, Sidestage may issue a valid VAT invoice to such Entertainer.<br>

	<h3>Foreign Currency</h3>

	As part of the Services, Sidestage may provide a feature through which Members may view Total Fees for various Listings in foreign currencies. You understand and agree that these views of Total Fees are for informational purposes only and are not the official Total Fees for the Listings. If you (as a Customer) request a booking, you will be notified of the currency in which you will be charged together with the corresponding amount of Total Fees if your booking is confirmed by an Entertainer. The currency in which you will be charged will be determined by Sidestage based on the payment method you select and the location of the Entertainer in the Listing you are booking. If the currency in which you will be charged is different from the currency chosen by the Entertainer to receive payment, Sidestage will be responsible for the required currency conversion processing, including the costs thereof, which will be calculated based on the most current applicable foreign exchange rate that Sidestage has uploaded to the Site as of the date and time that your booking is confirmed (the “Applicable Exchange Rate”). You acknowledge that the Applicable Exchange Rate used for currency conversion processing may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect at the specific time such processing occurs because: (i) although Sidestage updates the Applicable Exchange Rate on a regular basis, it does not update such rate on a real-time basis; and (ii) the Applicable Exchange Rate may include an incremental cost or margin that is not included in the applicable market rate. For the avoidance of doubt, Sidestage will retain any profits (and will bear any losses) that result from such currency conversion processing due to changes in the applicable foreign exchange rate between the date your booking is confirmed and the date Sidestage makes payment to an Entertainer.<br>

	<h3>Assignments</h3>

	You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Sidestage’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Sidestage may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.<br>

	<h3>Notices</h3>

	Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by Sidestage (i) via email (in each case to the address that you provide) or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.<br>

	<h3>Controlling Law & Jurisdiction</h3>

	These Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.<br>

	<h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>

	Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.<br>

	Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.<br>

	Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Sidestage otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Sidestage submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.<br>

	Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Sidestage will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.<br>

	Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Sidestage will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).<br>

	Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Sidestage changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to support@sidestage.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of Sidestage’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Sidestage in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).<br>

	<h3>General</h3>

	The failure of Sidestage to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Sidestage. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
